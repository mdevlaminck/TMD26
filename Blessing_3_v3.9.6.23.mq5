// Versions .10 thru .18 ...
//
// .10 Clean up for new versions of MT4 and potentially MT5,
//     passes #property strict added EnableOncePerBar to allow use of
//     Open Prices Only model of MT4 Strategy Tester to vastly speed up
//     optimization.  Filters out ticks!
//     Also a few bug fixes and cosmetic changes.
// .11 Repaired external parameters from .10 so they match the Blessing manual
// .12 Added UseMinMarginPercent control to keep margin from dropping too low.
// .13 Holiday bug fix.
// .14 Enhanced PortionPC behavior, settings over 100 force effective balance
//     to that amount.  Assuming real balance is greater.
// .15 Fixed divide by zero error
// .16 Fixed Draw Down display
// .17
// .18 Added MA_TF, to replace hardwired Current setting for more control
// .19 Skipped a-la-Windows 10
// .20 MT4/MT5 common source file - compiles for both platforms
// .21 Added Ichimoku Cloud from MT4 .16 version

#property version   "396.23"
#property strict


// MQL4&5-code

// Parallel use of MT4 and MT5 order systems.
// https://www.mql5.com/ru/code/16006

// This mqh-file after the corresponding #include allows you to work with orders in MQL5 (MT5-Hedge) in the same way as in MQL4.
// i.e. The order language system (SNR) becomes identical to MQL4. At the same time, it is possible to use PARALLELLY
// MQL5-order system. In particular, the standard MQL5 library will continue to work fully.
// You do not need to choose between order systems. Use them in parallel!

// When translating MQL4 -> MQL5, you do not need to touch the order system.
// Just add one line at the beginning (if the source can compile into MT4 with #property strict):

// #include <MT4Orders.mqh> // if there is #include <Expert / Expert.mqh>, insert this line AFTER

// Similarly acting (adding one line) in their MQL5-codes, you can add MT4-SNF to MT5-SNF, or completely replace it.

// The author created such an opportunity for himself, so he intentionally did not pursue a similar idea of transition "one line"
// for timeseries, graphic objects, indicators, etc.

// This work affects ONLY the order system.

// The question of the possibility of creating such a complete library, when MQL4-code can work in MT5 WITHOUT CHANGES, was not solved.

// What is not implemented:
// CloseBy-moments - until there was not before. Perhaps in the future, when needed.
// Definition of TP and SL of closed positions - at the moment (build 1470) MQL5 does not know how to do this.
// Accounting for DEAL_ENTRY_INOUT and DEAL_ENTRY_OUT_BY transactions.

// Features:
// In MT4 OrderSelect in SELECT_BY_TICKET mode selects a ticket regardless of MODE_TRADES / MODE_HISTORY,
// since "Ticket number is a unique order ID".
// In MT5, the ticket number is NOT unique,
// so OrderSelect in SELECT_BY_TICKET mode has the following selection priorities for matching tickets:
// MODE_TRADES: existing position> existing order> transaction> canceled order
// MODE_HISTORY: transaction> canceled order> existing position> existing order
//
// Accordingly, OrderSelect in the mode of SELECT_BY_TICKET in MT5 in rare cases (in the tester) can choose not what was conceived in MT4.
//
// If you call OrdersTotal() with the input parameter, the return value will match the MT5 variant.

// List of changes:
// 08.03.2016:
// Release - was written and checked only on the offline tester.
// 29.09.2016:
//    Add: the opportunity to work on the stock exchange (SYMBOL_TRADE_EXECUTION_EXCHANGE). Note that the exchange is Netto (not Hedge) -mode.
//    Add: The requirement "if there is #include <Trade / Trade.mqh>, insert this line AFTER"
//         replaced with "if there is #include <Expert / Expert.mqh>, insert this line AFTER."
//    Fix: OrderSend market orders returns a ticket position, not a trade.
// 13.11.2016:
//    Add: Complete synchronization OrderSend, OrderModify, OrderClose, OrderDelete with the trading environment (real-time and history) - as in MT4.
//         The maximum synchronization time can be set via MT4ORDERS::OrderSend_MaxPause in µs. The average synchronization time in MT5 is ~ 1 ms.
//         By default, the maximum synchronization time is one second. MT4ORDERS::OrderSend_MaxPause = 0 - no synchronization.
//    Add: Since the parameter Slippage (OrderSend, OrderClose) affects the execution of market orders only in Instant-mode,
//         then through it now, if desired, you can specify the type of execution for the remainder - ENUM_ORDER_TYPE_FILLING:
//         ORDER_FILLING_FOK, ORDER_FILLING_IOC, or ORDER_FILLING_RETURN.
//         In case of an erroneous job or no symbol support of the specified type of execution, the operating mode will be automatically selected.
//       Examples:
//         OrderSend(Symb, Type, Lots, Price, ORDER_FILLING_FOK, SL, TP) - send the corresponding order with execution type ORDER_FILLING_FOK
//         OrderSend(Symb, Type, Lots, Price, ORDER_FILLING_IOC, SL, TP) - send the corresponding order with execution type ORDER_FILLING_IOC
//         OrderClose(Ticket, Lots, Price, ORDER_FILLING_RETURN) - send the corresponding market order with the type of execution ORDER_FILLING_RETURN
//    Add: OrdersHistoryTotal() and OrderSelect(Pos, SELECT_BY_POS, MODE_HISTORY) are cached - they work as fast as possible.
//         There are no slow implementations in the library.
// 08.02.2017:
//    Add: The variables MT4ORDERS::__LastTradeRequest and MT4ORDERS::__LastTradeResult contain the corresponding MT5-OrderSend data.
// 14.06.2017:
//    Add: Included initially is the implementation of the definition of SL / TP closed positions (closed through OrderClose).
//    Add: MagicNumber now has the type long - 8 bytes (used to be int - 4 bytes).
//    Add: If the color input parameter in OrderSend, OrderClose or OrderModify (the most recent one) is set to INT_MAX, then the
//         corresponding trade MT5-request (MT4ORDERS::__LastTradeRequest), will NOT be sent. Instead, it will carry out its MT5-check,
//         the result of which will be available in MT4ORDERS::__LastTradeRequest.
//         If the check is successful, OrderModify and OrderClose return true, otherwise false.
//         OrderSend will return 0 in case of success, otherwise -1.
//
//         If the corresponding color input parameter is set to INT_MIN, ONLY in the case of a successful MT5-check of the generated
//         trade request (as in the case with INT_MAX) will it be sent.
//    Add: Added asynchronous analogs to MQL4-trading functions: OrderSendAsync, OrderModifyAsync, OrderCloseAsync, OrderDeleteAsync.
//         Return the corresponding Result.request_id in case of success, otherwise - 0.
// 03.08.2017:
//    Add: Added OrderCloseBy.
//    Add: The OrderSelect is speeded up in MODE_TRADES mode. Now it is possible to receive the data of the selected order through
//         corresponding MT4-Order functions, even if MT5-position / order (not in history) is selected not via MT4Orders.
//         For example, via MT5-PositionSelect * -functions or MT5-OrderSelect.
//    Add: Added OrderOpenPriceRequest () and OrderClosePriceRequest () - return the price of the trade request when the position is opened / closed.
//         With the help of these functions it is possible to calculate the corresponding order slips.
// 26.08.2017:
//    Add: Added OrderOpenTimeMsc () and OrderCloseTimeMsc () - the corresponding time in milliseconds.
//    Fix: Previously, all trade tickets had the int type, as in MT4. Because of the occurrence of cases of exceeding the limits of the int-type in MT5,
//         the type of tickets is changed to long. Accordingly, OrderTicket and OrderSend return long values. The return mode of the same type as in
//         MT4 (int) is turned on via writing the next line before #include <MT4Orders.mqh>
//
//         #define MT4_TICKET_TYPE // We bind OrderSend and OrderTicket to return a value of the same type as in MT4 - int.
// 03.09.2017:
//    Add: Added by OrderTicketOpen()  - Ticket MT5-transaction opening position
//                  OrderOpenReason()  - the reason for the MT5 opening deal (reason for opening the position)
//                  OrderCloseReason() - the reason for the MT5 closing deal (reason for closing the position)
// 14.09.2017:
//    Fix: Now the library does not see the current MT5-orders, which do not have the status ORDER_STATE_PLACED.
//         In order for the library to see all open MT5-orders, you need to register a line to the library
//
//         #define MT4ORDERS_SELECTFILTER_OFF // We require MT4Orders.mqh to see all current MT5-orders
// 16.10.2017:
//    Fix: OrdersHistoryTotal() reacts to the change of the account number at runtime.
// 13.02.2018
//    Add: Added logging of erroneous execution of MT5-OrderSend.
//    Fix: Now only the closing MT5-orders (SL / TP / SO, partial / full close) are "invisible".
//    Fix: The mechanism for determining SL / TP closed positions after OrderClose is corrected - it works if StopLevel allows.
// 15.02.2018
//    Fix: The MT5-OrderSend synchronization check now takes into account possible features of the ECN / STP implementation.
// 06.03.2018
//    Add: Added TICKET_TYPE and MAGIC_TYPE so that you can write a single cross-platform code without compiler warnings (including strict-mode MQL4).
// 30.05.2018
//    Add: Accelerated work with the history of trade, selected the golden mean of the realizations between productivity and
//         Memory consumption is important for VPS. A standard Generic library is used.
//         If you do not want to use the Generic library, then the old history mode is available.
//         To do this, you need to register a line before the MT4Orders library
//
//         #define MT4ORDERS_FASTHISTORY_OFF // Turn off the fast implementation of the trade history - do not use Generic-library.
// 02.11.2018
//    Fix: The opening price of the MT4 position before it triggers can no longer be zero.
//    Fix: Rare features of execution of some trading servers are taken into account.
// 26.11.2018
//    Fix: Magic and comment of the closed MT4 position: the priority of the corresponding fields of opening deals is higher than that of the closing ones.
//    Fix: Takes a rare change in MT5-OrdersTotal and MT5-PositionsTotal during the calculation of MT4-OrdersTotal and MT4-OrderSelect.
//    Fix: Orders that opened a position, but did not manage to retire MT5, are no longer taken into account by the library.
// 17.01.2019
//    Fix: Fixed an annoying error when selecting pending orders.
// 08.02.2019
//    Add: Position comment is saved when partially closed via OrderClose.
//         If you want to change the comment of an open position at partial closing, you can set it in OrderClose.
// 20.02.2019
//    Fix: If there is no MT5 order from the existing MT5 transaction, the library will wait for the history to be synchronized. In case of failure will report this.
// 13.03.2019
//    Add: Added OrderTicketID () - PositionID of an MT5 transaction or MT5 position, a ticket of a pending MT4 order.
//    Add: SELECT_BY_TICKET applies to all MT5 tickets (and MT5-PositionID).
// 02.11.2019
//    Fix: Lot, commission and closing price for CloseBy positions have been adjusted.
// 12.01.2020
//    Fix: OrderTicketID() for book transactions now returns the correct value.
//    Fix: Adjusted SELECT_BY_TICKET selection by OrderTicketID() (MT5-PositionID).
//    Fix: Changed the name of the internal library method for greater compatibility with macros.
// 10.04.2020
//    Fix: A partially executed live pending order did not fall into OrdersTotal().
// 09.06.2020
//    Add: Better StopLoss / TakeProfit / ClosePriceRequest prices for closed positions are better defined.
// 10.06.2020
//    Add: Added milliseconds and removed rounding of prices, volumes in OrderPrint().
// 13.08.2020
//    Add: Added the ability to check the performance of library parts through the MT4ORDERS_BENCHMARK_MINTIME macro.
// 20.08.2020
//    Fix: Taking into account the revealed features of partial order execution.
// 29.08.2020
//    Fix: Working with the history of trades has been accelerated.
// 30.09.2020
//    Add: If you need to increase the priority of MT5 order selection over MT5 position when selecting a live MT4 order by SELECT_BY_TICKET
//         (the tickets are the same), then this can be done by changing the ticket sign to negative: OrderSelect (-Ticket, SELECT_BY_TICKET).
//    Add: If you need to select only MT5 order when modifying a live MT4 order (tickets are the same),
//         then this can be done by changing the ticket sign to negative: OrderModify (-Ticket, ...).
//    Add: OrderSelect (INT_MAX, SELECT_BY_POS) - switch to MT5 position without checking for existence and updating.
//         OrderSelect (INT_MIN, SELECT_BY_POS) - switch to a live MT5 order without checking for existence and updating.
//    Fix: Working with the history of trades has been accelerated.
// 09/30/2020
//    Fix: Working with the history of trades has been accelerated.
